    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>Our AR mobile app does not collect any personal data, usage data, or any other information from its users. The

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is designed to be family-friendly and suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect any
        personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that we have inadvertently collected
        personal information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately, and we will take prompt action to
        delete such information from our records.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app does not integrate with any third-party services or platforms. We do not use any third-party analytics
        tools, advertising networks, or other services that could potentially collect data from our users.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will
